    "1. The data in each sample are randomly sampled and independent.\n",
    "2. The data in each sample are approximately normally distributed, especially for small sample sizes.\n",
    "3. The variances of the two populations are equal (for the pooled t-test) or can be unequal (for the Welch's t-test).\n",

    "## **Consequences of Not Meeting Assumptions**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Non-Normality**:\n",
    "    - **Two-sample t-test**: The t-test relies on the assumption that the data are approximately normally distributed, especially for small sample sizes. If this assumption is violated, the test statistic may not follow the t-distribution, leading to inaccurate p-values and confidence intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Two-Sample z-test**: The z-test assumes normality, but this is less critical for large sample sizes due to the Central Limit Theorem. However, for small sample sizes, non-normality can affect the accuracy of the test.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Unequal Variances**:\n",
    "    - **Two-Sample t-Test (Pooled)**: The pooled t-test assumes equal variances. If the variances are unequal, the pooled t-test can give misleading results, increasing the risk of Type I and Type II errors.\n",
    "    - **Two-Sample z-test**: Unequal variances can also affect the z-test, although this is less of a concern if the sample sizes are large and approximately equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Non-Independent Samples:**: Both the t-test and z-test assume that the samples are independent. If this assumption is violated, the test results can be biased, as the test statistics will not accurately reflect the true variability in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Addressing Violations of Assumtions**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Non-Normality**:\n",
    "    - **Transform the Data**: Apply transformations (e.g., log, square root) to make the data more normally distributed.\n",
    "    - **Non-Parametric Tests**: Use non-parametric tests like the Mann-Whitney U test, which do not assume normality.\n",
    "    - **Increase Sample Size**: Larger sample sizes can mitigate the effects of non-normality due to the Central Limit Theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Unequal Variances**\n",
    "    - **Welch's t-Test**: Use Welch’s t-test, which does not assume equal variances and adjusts the degrees of freedom accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Non-independent Samples**\n",
    "    - **Paired t-Test**: If the samples are paired or matched, use a paired t-test instead of an independent two-sample t-test."

The Two-Sample t-Test is used when comparing the means of two independent samples, while the z-Test is used when the population standard deviation is known and the sample size is large. It is important to check the assumptions for each test before performing the test to ensure its validity. The results of these tests can provide valuable insights and help make informed decisions in various fields such as science, business, and social sciences."
