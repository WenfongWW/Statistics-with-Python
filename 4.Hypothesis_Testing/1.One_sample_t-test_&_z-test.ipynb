    "**Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "A one-sample t-test is used to determine whether the mean of a single sample is significantly different from a known population mean when the population standard deviation is unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions**: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The sample data are randomly sampled from the population.\n",
    "2. The data are approximately normally distributed, especially for small sample sizes.(n < 30)\n",
    "3. The population standard deviation is unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula**\n",
    "The test statistic for a one-sample t-test is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "t = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu_0}{\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- xˉ= sample mean\n",
    "- 𝜇0= hypothesized population mean\n",
    "- 𝑠 = sample standard deviation\n",
    "- 𝑛 = sample size\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps**:\n",
    "1. **State the hypotheses**:\n",
    "    - Null hypothesis (H0): μ=μ0\n",
    "​\n",
    "    - Alternative hypothesis (H1) μ ≠ μ0 (one-tailed) or μ > μ0 or μ < μ0 (one-tailed)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Calculate the test statistic using the formula above.\n",
    "3. Determine the critical value from the t-distribution table with 𝑛 − 1 degrees of freedom.\n",
    "4. Compare the test statistic to the critical value or use the p-value to make a decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "A researcher wants to test whether the average height of a sample of 20 individuals is different from the population average height of 170 cm when the population standard deviation is unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What is the difference between a one-tailed and a two-tailed test in the context of a one-sample t-test?**\n",
    "    - A one-tailed test tests for a difference in one direction (either greater than or less than), while a two-tailed test tests for a difference in both directions (either greater than or less than the specified value).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How does the choice of significance level (𝛼) affect the results of a one-sample test?**\n",
    "    - A lower significance level (𝛼) makes it harder to reject the null hypothesis, reducing the likelihood of a Type I error (false positive). A higher significance level increases the risk of a Type I error.\n"
