    "The binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution that models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials of a binary (yes/no) experiment. It is widely used in statistics to describe the distribution of binary outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Characteristics\n",
    "1. **Fixed Number of Trials (n)**: The experiment is performed a fixed number of times.\n",
    "2. **Binary Outcomes**: Each trial has two possible outcomes, typically called \"success\" and \"failure\".\n",
    "3. **Constant Probability (p)**: The probability of success is the same for each trial.\n",
    "4. **Independence**: The outcomes of each trial are independent of each other."
