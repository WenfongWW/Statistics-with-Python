    "# **Poisson Distribution**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution that models the number of events occurring within a fixed interval of time or space. These events must occur with a known constant mean rate and independently of the time since the last event. It is often used to model the number of occurrences of events that happen at a constant average rate but are randomly spaced in time or space.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Key Characteristics**\n",
    "1. **Rate Parameter (ùúÜ)**: The average number of events in the given interval. It is both the mean and the variance of the distribution.\n",
    "2. **Discrete Nature**: The Poisson distribution is defined for non-negative integer values (0, 1, 2, ...).\n",
