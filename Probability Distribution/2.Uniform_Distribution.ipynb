    "### **Discrete Uniform Distribution**\n",
    "Definition: \n",
    "- A discrete uniform distribution is one where a finite number of values are equally likely to be observed. Every value in the set has the same probability. \n",
    "\n",
    "Properties:\n",
    "- **Finite set of values**: The set of possible outcomes is finite. \n",
    "- **Equal Probabilities**: Each outcome has an equal probability of occurring. \n",
    "\n",
    "Probability Mass Function (PMF):\n",
    "- For a discrete uniform distribution over n outcomes x1, x2,... xn, the PMF is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(X = x_i) = \\frac{1}{n} \\quad \\text{for } i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n\n",

    "Example: \n",
    "- Rolling a fair six-sided die: Each face (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) has an equal probability of 1/6. \n",

    "### **Continuous Uniform Distribution**\n",
    "\n",

    "- A continuous uniform distribution is one where any value within a specified range is equally likely to occur. \n",

    "\n",
    "**Properties**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interval [ùëé,ùëè]**: The possible outcomes are within a continuous range from ùëé to b.\n",

    "**Probability Density Function (PDF)**:\n",
    "- The PDF of a continuous random variable is a function that describes the likelihood of the random variable taking on a particular value. \n",
    "- The value of the PDF at any given point can be interpreted as providing a relative likelihood of the random variable being near that point. \n",

    "- For a continuous uniform distribution over the interval [a.b], the PDF is given by:\n",
